# Classification

This project is to implement and evaluate classification algorithms. The classification task will be to recognize a 28 × 28 grayscale handwritten digit image and identify it as a digit among 0, 1, 2, ... , 9. You are required to do the following three tasks.
1. Implement logistic regression, train it on the MNIST digit images and tune hyperparameters (Appendix 1).
2. Implement single hidden layer neural network, train it on the MNIST digit images and tune hyperparameters such as the number of units in the hidden layer (Appendix 2).
3. Use a publicly available convolutional neural network package, train it on the MNIST digit images and tune hyperparameters (Appendix 3).
4. Test your MNIST trained models on USPS test data and compare the performance with that of the MNIST data. Does your finding support the “No Free Lunch” theorem?
